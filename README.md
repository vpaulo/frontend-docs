# frontend-docs
Frontend documentation generation script.
It will generate markdown documentation files from the jsdoc in the javascript files.

You are able to add notes or extra infomation in the markdown files above the ```<!-- Auto Generated Below -->``` line and the script will keep this even after you run the script again.
